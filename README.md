<h4 align="center">Algorithms in JavaScript and their big O classifications</h4>

[Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) is a way to communicate the efficiency of an algorithm. I'm working my way thru implementing well-known algorithms using JavaScript and organizing them by their worst case time. If you spot something incorrect, I would be grateful if you [created an issue](https://github.com/cyk/big-o/issues) or [opened a PR](https://github.com/cyk/big-o/pulls).
